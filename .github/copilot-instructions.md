# Copilot Instructions for IB-CS-2027

## Project Overview
This repository contains various Python projects and examples, primarily focused on educational purposes. The projects include simulations, games, and algorithmic implementations. The codebase is organized into directories based on topics or teams, such as `OOP`, `L-Systems`, and `Examples`.

## Developer Workflows
### Running Projects
1. Navigate to the desired project directory.
2. Run the Python script using:
   ```bash
   python <script_name>.py
   ```

### Adding Dependencies
- Most projects use only the Python standard library. If external dependencies are added, document them in the project folder.

### Debugging
- Use `print` statements for debugging.
- For GUI-based projects, ensure the `tkinter` window is responsive during debugging.

## Project-Specific Conventions
### General
- Use `tkinter` for GUI-based projects.
- Follow object-oriented programming principles where applicable.

### Naming Conventions
- Use descriptive names for variables and functions.
- Class names should follow PascalCase.

### Code Structure
- Keep related functions and classes in the same file.
- Use comments to explain complex logic.

## Integration Points
### External Dependencies
- `tkinter`: Used for GUI development.
- `math`: Used for mathematical calculations.

## Notes for AI Agents
- Focus on maintaining readability and simplicity.
- Avoid introducing external dependencies unless necessary.
- Ensure GUI elements are responsive and visually appealing.
